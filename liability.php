      <p class="term_of_p">
          The Website and the Service are provided as-is. ReKar cannot be held liable for the incorrect functioning of the Website or the Service, including their lack of availability. ReKar has an obligation of means for the provision of the Service and the implementation of the Terms in general.

​

The User declares that he/she accepts the features and limitations of an online service, and in particular that he/she acknowledges:

​

​​

That he/she is aware of the risks of services provided online, especially in terms of response time;

That it his/her responsibility to take all necessary measures to ensure that the technical characteristics of his/her computer and/or computer network allow him/her to access the Website and use the Service;

That he/she understands that he/she is solely responsible for his/her access to the Internet;

That it is the User’s responsibility to take the appropriate measures to protect his/her own data and/or software from infection by the viruses circulating on the Internet or by any other electronic means.

​​

ReKar grants no express or implied warranties regarding the Website or the Service. The User is responsible for his/her choice to use the Service.

​

ReKar can in no case guarantee the solvency of the Users, including the Borrowers, even when the security deposit service is used.

​

As a business networking platform, ReKar does not control the User's’ identity documents or driving licenses.

​

The Users must check the identity of their contacts, the documents of the Car Owner’s Vehicle, and the Renter’s driving license at the time the Vehicle is taken.

​

ReKar also does not verify the information entered by Users in their Listings and evaluations. The User is deemed to be the sole author of the content of his/her listings and evaluations, and this content is his/her sole and entire responsibility. ReKar may not be held liable for any false, inaccurate, inappropriate or illicit information uploaded by a User.

​

ReKar may also not be held liable for removing or rendering inaccessible any obviously illicit content uploaded by a User.

​

In no event, may ReKar be held liable for any direct or indirect damage that might be caused by the Website or any part of the Service, or by the unavailability of the Website or any part of the Service.

​

By express agreement between the Parties, any moral or consequential damage, any loss of profits, turnover, orders, income or clientele, any loss of data and any action against the User by a third party and the consequences resulting therefrom are considered to be indirect damage.

​

ReKar's role is limited exclusively to the linking of Car Owners with Renters. ReKar will never lend out Vehicles via the Website or the Service. Accordingly, ReKar cannot be held liable for any damage suffered or caused by the Renter or the Car Owner using a Vehicle lent via the Website.

​

Without prejudice to the other provisions of the Terms and in accordance with the regulations, ReKar may be held liable in the case of serious misconduct committed intentionally by ReKar, its legal representatives or its employees.

​

Similarly, if it is proven that ReKar is directly responsible for endangering the lives of others. In general, ReKar may be held liable for violating its essential obligations to the Users due to wrongdoing on ReKar's part or that of its employees or legal representatives. In the event ReKar is held liable for such violations, this would be limited to harm that is certain, direct and foreseeable. All other liability on ReKar's part is excluded. The same exclusion applies to the personal liability of ReKar's legal representatives and employees.

​

Moreover, ReKar cannot be held liable for a User’s non-compliance with local regulations such as rules relating to tourism, car renting or any other local regulations and laws.
