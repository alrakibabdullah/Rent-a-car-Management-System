      <h5>A. Renting Price</h5><br>
      <p>The renting price consists of a daily renting price plus a per-kilometer price.</p><br>
      <p>The renting price is freely chosen by the Car Owner, provided that the daily renting price is not less than $10</p><br>
      <p>In order to provide Users the flexibility to manage special cases, ReKar does not choose the daily renting price.</p><br>
      <p>It is the User’s responsibility not to charge less than these minimum prices. ReKar reserves the right to refuse to validate renting below these minimum prices or, if the renting has already begun, to suspend payment to the Car Owner until the situation has been put right.</p><br>
      <p>The Renter represents that he/she has authorized ReKar to collect the different sums (renting price, security deposit, compensation, penalties and any other extra charges) in the name and on behalf of the Car Owner.</p><br>
      <p>Maximum number of kilometers per day is 150 KM, the Renter is charged 1% of the daily renting rate for every extra 1 kilometer.</p><br><br>
      <h5>B. Service Fees</h5><br>
      <p>The total renting price, penalties,toll charges, traffic tickets charges, ..etc for the Renter, breaks down as follows:</p><br>

       <p>The amount resulting from the Service Fees collected by ReKar for business networking.</p><br>
       <p>The fees collected by ReKar as follows:</p>
       <ul class="list-group">
          <li class="list-group-item">1. ReKar collects the renting fees and a security deposit when the renting is confirmed;</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">2. At the end of the renting, the Car Owner and the Renter adjust the mileage estimate made at the beginning of the renting via the Website or App. ReKar then either collects or pays the difference between the amount initially collected and the total price of the transaction, taking into account the mileage adjustments; ReKar pays 80% of the total renting price (and all other extra charges mentioned above) to the Car Owner within 45 business days of the end the renting and dispute settlement (if any);</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p>ReKar may suspend payment to the Car Owner if additional verification is required or if the Renter makes a claim/dispute.</p>

      <h5>C. Breakdown Management Fees</h5><br>
      <p>For any failure under normal use of the Vehicle by the Driver, the Owner is liable for $25 to ReKar fees.</p>
      <p>These breakdown management fees are applied to the Driver if it is held responsible for the failure in the context of an expert commissioned by the Owner</p>

    <div class="container cont2">
      <h5>D. Damage Management Fees</h5>
      <p>By renting the car, the Renter is agreeing to adhere to all the terms of the Car Owner’s car insurance policy, and is responsible to pay the insurance excess value as defined by the Car Owner’s insurance policy. Also the Renter is responsible, in case of his/her mistake, to pay an additional compensation fee equal to 10% of the car insurance value (paid to Car Owner) plus an administration fee of $50 (paid to ReKar). This amount doesn’t waive the renter from the other financial and legal responsibilities as defined in these Terms</p>
