      <h3 class="h1_letter">Use of the Website and the Apps:</h3>
      <p class="term_of_p">
         Users can create Listings. Several questions are asked about the Vehicle concerned to create the Listing, including its location, age, characteristics and availability, as well as its price and related rules and conditions. Listings will be published via the Website, App and Services. Other Users can reserve the Vehicle via the Website, the App and the Services in accordance with the information mentioned in the Listing.

​

To be Listed, Vehicles must comply with all of the following conditions:

​

Vehicle weighs less than 3.5 T;

Vehicle has 4 wheels (two- or three-wheeled Vehicles are not allowed);

Vehicle can carry a maximum of 9 persons including the driver (buses are not allowed);

Vehicle is registered in the country where it is offered for renting;

Vehicle has a full insurance coverage, and is covering the renting against all damages. As per any insurance policy, it can have an insurance excess value which shall be paid by the renter in case of any accident/damages;

In addition, sports Vehicles or Vehicles with a motor deemed too powerful by ReKar may be rejected.


The User understands and accepts that he/she cannot demand a higher price than that stated in the booking request.

​

Users acknowledge that they are fully responsible for the Listings they publish. They therefore represent and warrant that no Listings or Renting of Listed Vehicles by Renters violate any of the rules in force or agreements with third parties.

​

ReKar cannot be held liable for the violation of any agreement made between the Car Owner and a third party, or any breach of the Car Owner’s other obligations to third parties, or any violations of applicable laws, rules and regulations.

​

ReKar reserves the right to remove or disable access to any Listing at any time and without prior notice, for any reason whatsoever, including Listings that ReKar, at its sole discretion, deems contrary to these Terms or harmful to the Website, the App or the Services for any reason whatsoever.


ReKar provides the Car Owner certain tools to help make informed decisions about lending the Vehicle (in particular the renting price). The Car Owner acknowledges and agrees that he/she is liable for all of his/her acts and omissions. The Car Owner acknowledges and agrees that ReKar shall not intervene in his/her chosen renting price, which is the Car Owner’s decision alone.

​

However, ReKar reserves the right to remove a Listing, particularly if the renting price is less than the minimum provided for in these Terms. The minimum renting prices are provided in Article 11.A.

 

B. Non-Approval
​
ReKar does not stand as guarantor of any User or Vehicle. These Terms stipulate that Users must provide accurate information. Although ReKar may conduct additional identity and background checks on Users, we provide no statements, confirmations or approvals concerning Users, their identity or their background.

​

Users agree that, in the event of damage attributable to another User or a third party, they will only hold liable the party that caused the damage, and take action only against them. All Users agree to not attempt to hold ReKar liable or take legal action against ReKar for such acts or omissions.
